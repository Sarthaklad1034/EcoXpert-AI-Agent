## 🧩 Problem Statement

In the age of climate change and environmental degradation, people are increasingly aware of the need to adopt eco-friendly practices—but lack of localized, actionable guidance makes it difficult to start. Most information is scattered across websites, policy documents, or hard-to-find sources.

---

## ✅ Solution

EcoXpert bridges this gap by acting as a smart, conversational assistant. Powered by RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), it draws insights from indexed documents to answer real-time queries such as:
- “How do I reduce plastic use at home?”
- “Which government schemes support solar energy?”
- “What are eco-friendly product alternatives?”

EcoXpert delivers instant, factual, and localized guidance tailored for Indian users, helping them adopt sustainable habits and leverage relevant government schemes.
